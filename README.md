#### Special thanks
I want to thanks the 'Online Tutorials' YouTube Channel for teaching me how to work with those animations.
I couldn't find the repository, but there's a link to the channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers.
You'll find alot of useful information there
<br/><br/>
#### Quick note
If you try to code this application by yourself, make sure of using one of the css preprocessors, i have some troubles on the checkboxes on Opera and Safari
when i was using just raw css, so, using a preprocessor can make it simple for you
